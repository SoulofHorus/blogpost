      <h1>Step One: Making a GitHub page/repository</h1>
        <p>first of all, if you don't have a GitHub account make one. It is super easy. Then, make a respository labeled 'blogpost' or something similar. Once that is done, add an index.html file. Then, install Atom with Teletype so that when you type, auto complete can do it for you. Trust me, it is a life-saver.</p>
        <p>From here, you have to make sure you commit often, and make sure to push to origin. Save contantly.</p>

      <h1>Step Two: Logging onto the Terminal</h1>

        <p>Making this is going to be a wild ride, but something that is going to be annoying. Making this blog post will hopefully be a good thing.</p>
        <p> The first thing I did was take the example shell script and make it its own file. This file will be used at a later date. Once you acquire the password from your instructor. Log in. </p>
    </div>

    <div class= "step">
      <h1>Step Three: What Now?</h1>
        <p> Now that you are looking at the coding window, it asks you for your user name. Your username should be for the first part of your email. For example, mine is 'hammonkm'. Then using the IP address provided on Moodle, you can log in.</p>
        <p> Once that is done, using the log in code: $ ssh username@64.227.19.180, where username is the first part of your Clarkson email.</p>
    </div>

    <div class ="step">
        <h1>Step Four: Making a folder</h1>
          <p> To get your project on the web, you'll need to set up a directory inside the web root. To change from your initial working directory to the web root, run the following command: $ cd ../../var/www/html.</p>
          <p>Then, you can make your project directory inside the html folder. Please name it your username. You can put any number of other subdirectories inside it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class ="step">
        <h1> Step Five: You're Done!</h1>
          <p> Congratulations, you are done! Now you can use this folder to do whatever you like. Please be sure to use the command 'sudo' to change the permissions so you can access your own folder and make changes!</p>
